# Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes
This repository contains the code for the mathematical model presented in the paper: 'A Bi-Component Model to Assess the Rheology of Soft Cellular Aggregates Probed Using the Micropipette Aspiration Technique'
This repository contains the codes used to generate the results presented in Lavigne et al.1. This paper proposes a proof of concept for a poroelastic model to account to simulate the mechanical behaviour of human skin. A two-layer model has been considered and a calibration procedure has been performed to reproduce the apparent viscoelasticity of in vivo human skin, using a porous media approach.
