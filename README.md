This repository contains the code for the mathematical model presented in the paper: 'A Bi-Component Model to Assess the Rheology of Soft Cellular Aggregates Probed Using the Micropipette Aspiration Technique'
This repository contains the codes used to generate the results presented in Lavigne et al.1. This paper proposes a proof of concept for a poroelastic model to account to simulate the mechanical behaviour of human skin. A two-layer model has been considered and a calibration procedure has been performed to reproduce the apparent viscoelasticity of in vivo human skin, using a porous media approach.

## Archive organization
* _Experimental data_ contains the excel file with the data about the aspiration and retraction phase of the micropipette aspiration experiment;
* _Images_ contains all the images reported in the [paper](https://www.i2m.u-bordeaux.fr/L-institut-UMR-5295/pages_perso/Sciume-Giuseppe) ; 
* _Fenics_ contains the codes used for non-wetting and partially-wetting cases including the final set of parameters identified.

## Version
The numerical simulations have been performed using the legacy FEniCS environnement which has been installed following the instructions available in the [FEniCS website](https://fenicsproject.org/download/)
